# Watercansolution
------------------------------------------------------------
A prototype "Mesurable Fluid" delivery management system.
  (as this system can be extended to)
  * Gas (in vehicle fuel tank)
  * LGP gas cylinder
  * and household water storage

- We are here concerned about drinking WATER CAN
- Its drinking packaged water of 20l
- Existing Distributors are to 2 type
  * Bislery - Coca-Cola product
  * Local water purifires (not much reliable)

- Primary Challenge to solve
  "on demand water supply"

- A case study

  Water can consumers often come into situation when water can gets empty and
  user repent, why they were not prompt to order early.

- Existing system

  User calls(should have a connection before, which user can find from service
  like just dial)va water delievery boy , who gets it from local store or uses
  his vechile to fetch and deliver it to user.

  Some distributers are on large water can storage vans and distributes it.

- Challenge

  Because, water consumption varies from household to household having stable
  subscription based delivery gets challenging and isn't too prompt.

- Proposed Solution

  * A smart consumer distributor environment
  * A system which calibrates water in container and sends notification/orders
    to stystem users
  * Users are mapped on the water intake spectra and are informed about the
    pattern

- I will procced in 4 stages.

* Stage 1.

To start your Phoenix server:

  * Install dependencies with `mix deps.get`
  * Create and migrate your database with `mix ecto.create && mix ecto.migrate`
  * Install Node.js dependencies with `cd assets && npm install`
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.
